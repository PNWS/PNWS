# PNWS
Face shield design to aid first line responders during the COVID19 Epidemic.   
This design was created by members of the Washington Sate 3D Face Shield Hub.

This is an update of "DtM-v3.1 Face Shield PPE, 3D printable headband NO LOGO", item 
3DPX-013359. 

## Updates made based on clinical feedback are:
* Reduced mass and print time
* Improvements to shield retention while reducing stress applied to the shield itself.
* Thinned forehead section to reduce pressure on the forehead
* Mount peg spacing changed for equivalency to "Swedish" headband
* Added brimless variant to further reduce print time and mass
* Added engineering definition for face shield and headband
* Added cloth tie clips as an option
* Added option of foam headband
* Increased spacing to improve wearability with glasses and N95 mask underneath.
* Reduced weight solves for headaches from all-day wear of previous model 
* Optimised build and assembly to standard materials that can be readily purchased (e.g., US letter-sized transparency) 

## Product Point of View
Due to a domestic supply chain gap for transparent face shields, this remixed 3D printed design immediately provides personal protective equipment (PPE) to healthcare workers responding to COVID-19, and incorporates clinical feedback and clinical reviews from other similar designs being used across hospitals across the nation. Face shield characteristics: 
* limits aerosol and splatter exposure directly to the anterior head, specifically to the face and from above the head, while providing top ventilation to limit fogging and condensation
* reduces aerosol and splatter exposure on N95 and other face masks; this follows current recommendations to use full face shields to protect limited supply N95 masks
* re-usable for a single user (can survive multiple daily washes; transparent visor can be replaced from readily sourced materials when worn out)

easy to fabricate within a few days of design approval (i.e., no complex supply chains or production bottlenecks)
comfortable to wear and easy to don and doff (as it will be taken on and off dozens of times in a 12-24 hour shift)
provides protection to broader area of face compared to standard safety goggles or glasses

Once you download the fabrication package you will be see there is an assembly drawing and a Bill Of Materials, please open these first to help decide which parts you would like to print.

## What to make?

### I want to Mass Produce the PNWS:
If you would like to bring the PNWS into mass production download our Mass Production ready package, this includes all the files you would need to mass produce full kits of the PNWS, this includes files and drawings for the short variant of an injection molded frame.

We recomend shipping and packaging in kits of 25 in a 380mm x 300mm x 75mm (15"x12"x3") sized box.

### How do I put it all together?
